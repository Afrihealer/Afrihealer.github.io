		<h2> EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ALOE</h2>
		<h4>ORIGINS</h4></section>
		<p><h3>Aloe belongs to the Liliaceae, a family of perennial tropical plants of African origin. Species of aloe that have been used as folk medicine include Curaçao aloe (A. vera), Cape aloe (A. ferox Mill.) and Socotra aloe (A. perryi Baker). The use of aloe vera as folk medicine dates to antiquity, and there is an early account from around 1500 bc.The name aloe is from the Greek word and refers to the bitter juice from the leaves of these plants. It is probably derived from the earlier Arabic word alloeh or the Hebrew word allal, both meaning shining bitter substance (Sung, 2006). In biblical times, the Egyptians hailed aloe vera as the plant of immortality. The Chinese called it their elixir of youth. Aloe vera has many common names and is often referred to as the burn plant, first aid plant or medicine plant, as well as being called true aloe or plain aloe vera. It is considered to be a native plant of Somalia with a history dating back to the 4th century bc <h3>

	<h3>Although aloe is reported to have originated in tropical Africa, it is now cultivated in the warm climatic areas of Asia, Europe and America (Coats, 1979). The majority of species occur in southern Africa and on the eastern side of that continent. Many other species are found on the Arabian Peninsula and in Madagascar. The Arabian species have strong relationships with the species of north-east Africa. Madagascan species appear not to be closely related to those of mainland Africa and so active speciation seems to have occurred since the separation of these two land masses. There are over 350 species of aloe grown the world over. However, only two species are grown commercially: A. vera (Fig. 1.1) and 
 A. arborescens Mill. There are at least two other species that have medicinal properties, namely A. perryi and A. ferox. Most aloe vera plants are non-toxic, but a few are extremely poisonous and contain a hemlock-like substance (Atherton, 1998). A. variegata L. is a dwarf species that is only a few centimetres in diameter and is a popular houseplant.</h3>

MOPHOLOGY
<p><h3>Aloe vera is a spiky cactus-like xerophyte. It is a clump-forming perennial plant with a thick fibrous root and large basal leaves, usually 12–16 per plant. It weighs up to 1.5 kg when 
mature. The plant matures when it is about 4 years old and has a lifespan of about 12 years. The leaves are up to 0.5 m long and 8–10 cm across at the base, tapering to a point, with saw-like teeth along their margins. In transverse section, the plant shows a slightly concave appearance on the adaxial surface and a distinctly convex appearance on the lower abaxial surface (Grindlay and Reynolds, 1986; Naik and Annamalai, 2013). The leaves are usually covered with thick cuticle which is differentiated into an upper chlorenchyma and a lower parenchyma. As the rosette matures, successive leaves have fewer whitish spots and become grey to greenish in colour (Eshun and He, 2004). The plant can be harvested every 6–8 weeks by removing 3–4 leaves per plant. Red, yellow, purple or pale striped flowers are 
 present for most of the year growing in a long raceme at the top of the flower stalk which 
 originates from the centre of the basal leaves. The flower stalk grows up to 1.5 m in height. The fruit is a triangular capsule containing numerous seeds (Grindlay and Reynolds, 1986).</h3>

	USES of Alovera
<p><H3>
Aloe healthy benefits ae very strong however the truth is some manufactures uses premature aloe to manufacture their products therefore it might be less effective .also alovera have a lot of recipes tradional african recipes which are very effective for healing,curing serious diseases. Some of these, and other benefits of aloe vera, are further described and explained in the African medic series
Skin penetration enhancement
Aloe vera gel has been shown to increase 
 in vitro skin penetration of compounds depending on their molecular weight, with an apparent inverse correlation between enhancement ratio and molecular weight of the compound (Moser et al., 2001; Cole and Heard, 2007).

 <h4>ANTIDIABETIC EFFECTS</h4>

<h3>Several trials have shown a blood glucose lowering effect following the consumption of aloe vera gel. It significantly reduced fasting blood glucose, hepatic transaminases, plasma and tissue cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and phospholipids, and in addition also significantly increased plasma insulin levels. It was reported by Rajasekaran et al. (2006) that the mechanism of action of aloe vera extracts in reducing blood glucose levels is by enhancing glucose metabolism due to its antioxidant mechanism.</h3>
<h4>IMMUNOMODULATORY EFFECTS</h4>
<h2>Immunomodulation activities of the polysaccharides in aloe vera gel may be via activation of macrophage cells to generate nitric oxide, secrete cytokines (e.g. tumour necrosis factor-alpha or TNF-α, interleukin-1 or IL-1, interleukin-6 or IL-6, and interferon-g or INF-g) and present cell surface markers. It is reported that relatively high concentrations of acemannan are required to achieve modest activation of macrophages by aloe vera.</h2>

<h3>Anti-inflammatory effects
The anti-inflammatory activity of mannose- 6-phosphate is believed to resemble the 
 effects observed for acetylated mannan in aloe gel. Aloe gel is reported to reduce agent-induced inflammation via the promotion of prostaglandin synthesis as well as via increased infiltration of leucocytes. It has also been shown to significantly reduce leucocyte adhesion and levels of TNF-α (Prabjone et al., 2006).</H3></h3>
